<p>When trying to by a fish. It all depends on what type of fish your looking to buy, pet 
    stores usually have a wide section to chose from. Aquarium stores have employees well
    educated to teach new fish owners.They can guide you to make sure you select the right 
    fish and the equipment for that type of fish. When looking for a specific breed, you might

<h3 class="heading">How Often Do Fish Need To Be Fed?</h3>
<p>One interesting fact about fish is that don't have stomach, so they basically they don't 
    stop eating. However that does not mean keep feeding it. You only need to feed the fish 
    twice a day. You will need to do research of the type of fish you have. Overfeeding fish 
    is a common mistake for owners to make.</p>
    <p>A plus about fish ownership is that you can buy it a automatic feeder or food block for 
        the inside of the aquarium. When you go away, rather than finding someone to take care 
        of your fish or feed them. Goldfish cal last a week without food but that doesn't mean
        to not feed them, or wait that long between feedings. </p>
